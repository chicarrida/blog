I made the shape of Berlin out of mashed potatoes as the most people living in Berlin are still germans and potatoes are very german to me. I flavoured Spandau with Vodka and pickled cucumbers, guess who lives here :) For Poland I took instant borschtsch and sauerkraut, coconutmilk and lemongrass for Vietnamese, humus and dried dates for arabian and garlic and feta cheese for the turkish people.

I asked the other participants of my course to try it and guess which taste refers to what country. This was fun, as Beverley from Singapore has a totally different taste assumption I'll call it.
